**Objective**

The Home Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for learning new tools and malware simulation all the while detecting this cyber attack. The primary focus was to create this sandbox environment to test out tools and investigate malware while having the freedom to break things without consequence. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, techniques, and a deeper understanding of how systems and networks function.

**Summary**

In my home lab, I used the virtualization software “VirtualBox” as our hypervisor to set up both a Kali Linux machine acting as our attacker machine, along with a Windows 10 machine with Splunk and Sysmon as our victim machine with our SIEM on it giving us the telemetry to catch evil.

**Skills Learned**

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Network configuration by segmenting lab environment from personal network

**Tools Used**

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system Splunk for log ingestion and analysis.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Port scanning tools (such as nmap).
- Payload generation tool (such as msfvenom).
